              As tech companies have grown and expanded their global reach, there has been increasingly visible backlash and
              resistance against their practices from both inside and outside the industry.
              This timeline highlights more than 100 protests over the last ten years selected from publicly available information.
              It offers a view into the consequences of tech companiesâ€™ decisions, policies, and
              practices and their impact on their workforce, users, contractors, vendors, clients, and customers.
